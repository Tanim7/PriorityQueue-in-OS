# PriorityQueue-in-OS
Priority Queue is used in Operating Systems kernel as part of the scheduling algorithm. Briefly, when a process cannot continue running (perhaps because it 
is waiting for some event such as input/output), the OS has to choose which waiting process that is ready to run gets control of the CPU. Part of this algorithm involves a priority queue where the ready processes are ordered 
by their priority. All things being equal, the highest priority task will be allowed to run.
